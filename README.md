Ringer & Notification Volume Unlink
===================================

Separate ringer & notification volume link in Android ICS/JB

This is a Xposed module so your phone must be rooted to use it. The module is based on Android AOSP framework source code so it should work on AOSP or AOSP-based ROMs. I tested it using my Sony Xperia ZR phone with 4.2.2 stock ROM.

Installation instructions:
1. Install the module
2. Run Xposed Installer and enable the module Separate ringer & notification volume link in ICS/JB
3. Reboot the phone
